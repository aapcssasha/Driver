        <p>The University of Michigan reported that the U.S. consumer sentiment fell to a six-month low in 
            its preliminary reading for May. The metric fell from April's final reading of 63.5 to 57.7, 
            marking its lowest since November 2022. The consensus estimate was 63.</p>
        <p>The present situation sub-index, which measures the consume's thinking about their current financial situation,
            dropped to 64.5 in May from 68.2 in April. The Expectation sub-index, which measures consumer's 
            expectation for next six month, declined to 53.4 in May from 60.5 in April.</p>
        <p>Consumer's expectations for near-term inflation declined marginally in May to 4.5% after climbing 4.6% in April 
            from 3.6% in March. However, inflation expectations over the next five years rose to 3.2% from 3% in April, 
            reflecting its highest reading since 2011. The report said that the “Consumer's worries about the economy 
            escalated in May alongside the proliferation of negative news about the economy, including the debt crisis 
            standoff.”</p>
        <p>A significant drop in consumer sentiment is very bad for the U.S. economy. Weak sentiment may result in a 
            contraction in consumer spending going forward. However, consumer spending is the biggest driver of the U.S. 
            economy constituting more than 2/3 of the GDP. Low consumer spending may lead to a recession.</p>
