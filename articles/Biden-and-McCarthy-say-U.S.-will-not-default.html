        <h1 class="titulo"> Biden, McCarthy say U.S. won't default as debt talks inch forward</h1>
        <p class="Article-time">Published: May 17, 2023 at 1:55 p.m. ET</p>
        <p class="subtitle">House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told CNBC in an interview he does not think the U.S. will default on its debt as tense negotiations over the debt ceiling continue.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">President Joe Biden echoed that sentiment later in remarks from the White House.</p>


        <p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer secured $31 billion in financing on Tuesday, as companies pick up the pace of
            borrowing ahead of potential market turmoil tied to the U.S. debt-ceiling fight.</p>

        <p> Pfizer PFE, -0.40% borrowed the funds via an eight-tranche bond deal that will go toward its roughly $43
            billion acquisition of Seagan, a biotech focused on creating therapies to treat cancer, according to public
            documents tied to the financing.</p>

        <p> Pricing on the bonds, rated A1 by Moodys Investors Service, narrowed about 20 basis points from initial
            expectations, with the $5 billion class of 10-year bonds clearing at a spread of 125 basis points above the
            risk-free Treasury rate TMUBMUSD10Y, 3.522%, or a yield of about 4.7%, according to a person with direct
            knowledge of the dealings.</p>

        <p> Bankers initially pitched the bonds to investors at a range of Treasurys plus 145 basis points, according to
            CreditSights. Lower spreads mean investors receive less compensation.</p>

        <p>The bond deal ranks as the fourth-largest on record for the U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market,
            according to data from Informa Global Markets.</p>

        <p>Analysts at BofA Global this week noted an uptick in U.S. investment-grade corporate bond supply, with
            issuance in May (see chart) already exceeding the $69 billion priced in April.</p>
